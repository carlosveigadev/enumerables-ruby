# Building Blocks - Enumerables

> In this project, I implemented my own version of [Ruby’s enumerable methods](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.1/Enumerable.html).

The following methods were created and tested:
- my_each
- my_each_with_index
- my_select
- my_all?
- my_any?
- my_none?
- my_count
- my_map
- my_inject
